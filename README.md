# webScrapperBcaGehu
A simple test web scrapper using beautiful soup for extracting results data from the offical site.
The script will only work when the site is working.

This script with a little modification can be used to extract every streams results.
The output file are in the everyResult.txt file they are not edited further ! 

This is just a fun project and no harm is intended.
